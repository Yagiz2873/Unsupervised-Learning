As you can see in this repository, I've learnt to use list comprehensions, lambda functions and .apply() method in datasets firts. Then I've learnt to use unsupervised learning algorithms
(K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms) to cluster datasets. I've learnt to create elbow and dendrogram graphs to evaluate and find optimum numbers of clusters for both algorithms. Finally
I've learnt to create some visuals (histograms for analyzing numerical data, boxplots for finding outliers, pairplot for analyzing multiple columns as pairs) by using seaborn library's visualization functions.
